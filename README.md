# domino

This is the Git repo for domino, an Android app that lets you create small programs with your phone's sensors and actuators. 

## Project rationale:

Arduinos are neat. But they’re expensive and out-of-reach for many kids. We sought to leverage what's already built into most mobile phones to provide the same learning experiences that affluent children might receive with microcontrollers such as Arduinos in makerspaces or computer science classes.
